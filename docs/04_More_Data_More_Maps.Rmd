Now that we know how to pull in data, check and transform Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS), and plot `sf` data.frames together - let's practice doing the same thing with other geometry types. In this notebook we'll be bringing in bike boulevards and schools, which will get us primed to think about spatial relationship queries.

### Import Libraries

```{r, message=F}
library(sf)
library(here)
```

#### Load some data
```{r}
counties = st_read(here("notebook_data",
                        "california_counties",
                        "CaliforniaCounties.shp"))

ca_places = st_read(here("notebook_data",
                         "census",
                         "Places",
                         "cb_2019_06_place_500k.shp"))
```

## Mapping `sf` objects

Just like with other plots we can make in R, we can customize our maps' colors, title, etc.

The most basic way to do this would be to use the `sf::plot` function.

```{r}
# Make a map with plot
plot(counties$geometry, col='tan', border='darkgreen', main="CA counties")
```


However, we'll get much more functionality and customizability if we use a special-purpose mapping package, rather than just relying on `sf` methods of base R functions.

## R packages for Mapping `sf` objects

There are many different packages you can use to make maps of `sf` data, including:

- `ggplot2`: which is fantastic if you are already a ggplot user
- `mapview`: for a quick and easy interactive map
- `tmap`: for great custom static and interactive maps
- `leaflet`: for highly custom interactive maps that you can output and host on a website
- `shiny`: for interactive R based applications that use leaflet maps

We won't cover leaflet or shiny, but we will present an quick look at ggplot2 and mapview and then dive into tmap.

### Maps with ggplot

Here is a simple example of a ggplot map syntax. 
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(counties, aes(fill = MED_AGE)) + 
  geom_sf() +  # tells ggplot that geographic data are being plotted
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "2010 Median Age by County")
```

### Maps with `mapview`

The `mapview` package is the easiest way to make a basic interactive map with very little code. 

- See the documentation (?mapview) or webpage (https://r-spatial.github.io/mapview) for more info.

```{r, eval=F}
library(mapview)

# Interactive map of counties
mapview(counties)

# with areas colored by data values
mapview(counties, zcol = 'MED_AGE')

# and overlaying CA Places data
mapview(counties, zcol = 'MED_AGE') + mapview(ca_places)

```
Mapview is great for exploring your data. Less great for making pretty custom maps.

## 4.2 Mapping with `tmap`

Our go-to mapping package of choice is [`tmap`](https://github.com/mtennekes/tmap). Its name stands for "thematic maps", i.e. maps in which you can use the attribute values of the features to control the style properties of the geometry, thus creating effective data visualizations. 

`tmap` is great for creating both static and interactive maps.

You'll get plenty of introduction here in the workshop, but for additional support you can check out the [tmap vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/vignettes/tmap-getstarted.html) or Google other tutorials and references.

The [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/adv-map.html) book also has a great chapter on making maps with `tmap` and other `R` libraries.

Let's start by loading the package and creating a 'quick tmap'.

```{r}
# load tmap
library(tmap)

# make tmap fix invalid polygons
tmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE)

# plot a 'quick tmap'
qtm(counties)
```

Nice!

That's the quickest, simplest example of a static map that `tmap` can make. 


#### About `tmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE)`

- Sometimes during data creation or processing, polygon geometry gets a bit messed up. It may look great but one or more of the polylines may self-intersect or not close (i.e. snap to a node). This can cause some functions to return an error message or warning.  The `tmap_option` **check.and.fix** and repair invalid geometry so that it can render an interactive or static map properly.  You can also use the `sf` function **st_make_valid** to repair invalid geometry. See the function documentation for more information.

```{r}
# save fixed geom
counties <- st_make_valid(counties)
```

### Toggling `tmap` modes

`tmap` has 2 modes:

- Use `tmap_mode('plot')` to set the mapping mode for static maps

- Use `tmap_mode('view')` to set the mapping mode for interactive maps

- use `ttm()` to quickly toggle between modes

`tmap` loads up in 'plot' mode. Let's switch it to 'view' mode and then take a look at that same map. 


```{r}
# toggle the mode (or ttm!)
ttm()
```

```{r}
# then make our quick tmap again
qtm(counties)
```
That's outstanding! We get a clickable, scrollable, zoomable map built with the [Leaflet Javascript library](https://leafletjs.com/)... right out of the box!

- You can change the **basemap** using the `Layer Control` under the `Zoom Controls`.

And to create thematic maps, we can use `tmap`'s more verbose mapping functions to create a new `tmap` object and then add geometry layers to it, setting different aesthetic aspects of those layers.

For now, let's recreate that same map we made above with `plot`, but this time using `tmap` syntax:

```{r}
tm_shape(counties) +  # use the `tm_shape` function to create a tmap object
  tm_polygons(col = 'tan', # add `tm_polygons` layer, coloring as before
              border.col = 'darkgreen', 
              alpha = 0.5) # & making transparent
```

Above, `tm_shape` creates the new `tmap` object by identifying the data source for the first map layer (`counties`).  Then, `tm_polygons` provides the aesthetics for how the data should be displayed.

- If we only want to display the polygon outlines we would use `tm_borders` instead of `tm_polygons`:

```{r}
tm_shape(counties) +  # use the `tm_shape` function to create a tmap object
  tm_borders(col = 'darkgreen', 
             alpha = 0.85) 
```



Now we have two primary mapping tools:

    - `plot`: nice for simple, pared down plotting tasks
    - `tmap`: quick maps, both static and interactive, with greater flexibility
    
## 4.3 More Data, More Maps!

In this section we are going to bring in some new data for mapping

- Berkeley Bike Boulevards
- Alameda County Schools

First, we will read in the Berkeley bike boulevards in data. Note two things that are different from our previous data:

- We're reading in data from a [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON) file and not a shapefile

- The data have **line** geometry (our county and states data had **polygon** geometries)

```{r}
bike_blvds = st_read(here("notebook_data",
                          "transportation",
                          "BerkeleyBikeBlvds.geojson"))

plot(bike_blvds$geometry)
```

Of course, we could also use `tmap` to plot our lines:

```{r}
# set to interactive view mode
tmap_mode('view')

tm_shape(bike_blvds) +
  tm_lines()
```

As usual, we'll want to do a bit of data exploration...

```{r}
head(bike_blvds)
```

```{r}
dim(bike_blvds)
```

```{r}
colnames(bike_blvds)
```

Our bike boulevard data includes the following information:

 - `BB_STRNAM` - bike boulevard Streetname
 - `BB_STRID` - bike boulevard Street ID
 - `BB_FRO` - bike boulevard origin street
 - `BB_TO` - bike boulevard end street
 - `BB_SECID`- bike boulevard section id
 - `DIR_` - cardinal directions the bike boulevard runs
 - `Status` - status on whether the bike boulevard exists
 - `ALT_bikeCA` - ? 
 - `Shape_len` - length of the boulevard in meters 
 - `len_km` - length of the boulevard in kilometers
 - `geometry`


<img src="http://www.pngall.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Light-Bulb-Free-PNG-Image.png" width="20" align=left >  **Question**

Why are there 211 features when we only have 8 bike boulevards?


And now take a look at our CRS...

```{r}
st_crs(bike_blvds)
```

We can see that the CRS of the bike blvds dataframe is UTM Zone 10N, NAD83. This is a common CRS for locations in Northern CA.

### Alameda County Schools

Alright! Now that we have reviewed the bike boulevard data, we're going to bring in Alameda County school data.

```{r}
schools_df = read.csv(here("notebook_data",
                           "alco_schools.csv"))

head(schools_df)
```

```{r}
dim(schools_df)
```

<img src="http://www.pngall.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Light-Bulb-Free-PNG-Image.png" width="20" align=left >  **Questions** Without looking ahead:

1. Is this a geodataframe? 
2. How do you know?


<br>
<br>
This is not an `sf` data.frame! A couple of clues to figure that out are..

1. We're reading in data from a `Comma Separated Value (CSV)` file, which is not a geospatial data file format.
2. There is no geometry column (although we do have latitude and longitude values).

We can also check the object class of the dataframe.
```{r}
class(schools_df)
```

-------------------------------

Although we are loading the school data as a regular, non-spatial data.frame, we can use the function `st_as_sf` to transform it into an `sf` spatial data.frame by:

- specifying the columns that contain the point coordinates 

- and the identifying the CRS of the data

Let's take another look at the dataframe. 

- What columns contain the point coordinates?
- What is the CRS of the point data?

```{r}
head(schools_df, 2)
```

Now lets use the `st_as_sf` function and what we know about the data to convert the dataframe to an `sf` spatial dataframe.
```{r}
schools_sf = st_as_sf(schools_df,               # the name of the dataframe to make spatial
                       coords = c('X', 'Y'),    # the cols in that dataframe that contain the X & Y coordinate values
                       crs = 4326)              # the CRS, expressed as an EPSG code

# Take a look at the output
head(schools_sf)
```


You'll notice that the spatial dataframe is almost the same as the regular data.frame, except with one less column (because the two coordinate columns, `X`, and `Y`, were consumed into a single `geometry` column.


We can also check the `class` of the output spatial dataframe...
```{r}
class(schools_sf)
```

Check the dimensions (number of rows and columns) - *is it the same as for schools_df?*
```{r}
dim(schools_sf)
```

#### Plot the point data

Now that it's an `sf` data.frame, we can make a map of the schools with the `plot` function, just as we did for our other data sets. Notice that this is our first **point** dataset.

```{r}
plot(schools_sf)
```

<img src="http://www.pngall.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Light-Bulb-Free-PNG-Image.png" width="20" align=left >  **Question**

#### How do we plot just the school points?
```{r}
# plot the school points only
#plot(...)  
```

#### How can we use `plot` to overlay the schools on the Berkeley Bike Boulevards?

- What might we need to first?
```{r}
# Hint
st_crs(schools_sf) == st_crs(bike_blvds)
```

So, we'll want to transform the CRS to match that of our bike boulevard data.
```{r}
# What are we setting the CRS to?
schools_utm10 = st_transform(schools_sf, st_crs(bike_blvds))
```

And make a map overlay of the two layers
```{r}
plot(bike_blvds$geometry)
plot(schools_utm10$geometry, col= "red", add=T)
```


### Plotting point data in `tmap`

We can also use `tmap` to plot any of our spatial dataframes.

Here, we can use the tmap `tm_dots` function for point data:

```{r}
tm_shape(schools_utm10) +
  tm_dots(col = 'purple', 
          border.col = 'white', 
          border.lwd = 2, 
          size = 0.2)
```

### Writing Data to a CSV file

In Lesson 2 we reviewed how to save `sf` data.frames to multiple file formats, such as the `GeoJSON` or `shapefile` formats, etc. However, point data is also often saved to a CSV file.

```{r, eval=F}
st_write(obj = schools_utm10, 
         dsn = here("outdata",
                    "schools_utm10.csv"), 
         layer_options = "geometry=AS_XY", 
         delete_dsn = T)
```
 
Use the RStudio File browser to take a look at the output.

## 4.4 Map Overlays with `tmap`

We can combine multiple spatial dataframes of different geometry types to create overlay maps.

Let's take a look at how we do this in `tmap` with the schools and bike boulevard dataframes.

- Note, we add lines to the `tmap` with the `tm_lines` function.

```{r}
tm_shape(schools_utm10) + 
  tm_dots(size = 0.1) +
  tm_shape(bike_blvds) +
  tm_lines(col = 'red')
```

<img src="http://www.pngall.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Light-Bulb-Free-PNG-Image.png" width="20" align=left >  **Questions**   What `tmap` functions do we use to 

- identify the spatial object that will be plotted?
- add polygons to the map?
- add polygon outlines but not the fill?
- add points?
- add lines?

### Practice

Now try remaking the previous map with the `schools_sf` dataframe instead of the `schools_utm10` dataframe. What does the output tell you about `tmap`?

```{r}
## Your code here!

```

> Yeh, `tmap` will dynamically transform (reproject) spatial dataframes so that they can overlay in the same map if the CRS of each dataframe is defined. If it is not defined, `tmap` will assume the WGS84 CRS (EPSG code 4326).

### Asking questions of the data

If we want to answer questions like *"What schools are close to bike boulevards in Berkeley?"*, the above plot isn't super helpful, since the extent covers all of Alameda county.

- How could you answer this question with the data we have used in this lesson?


## Exercise: Overlay Mapping

Let's practice reading in and mapping some additional spatial data.

In the code cell provided below, write code to:

1. Extract the Berkeley boundary from the CA Places data
2. Create a static tmap with the Berkeley boundary, the Berkeley Bike Boulevards, and the Alameda County Schools, subset to the city of Berkeley.
3. Repeat the above as an interactive `tmap`.

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE







```

## Solution hidden here!

*To see it, right-click and select "inspect element" in your browser (or look in the `04_More_Data_More_Maps.Rmd` file near line 427).*

<!--

# SOLUTION

# 1. Subset Berkeley from CA places data
berkeley = ca_places[ca_places$NAME == 'Berkeley',]

# 2. Subset the schools to Berkeley
berkeley_schools = schools_sf[schools_sf$City == 'Berkeley',]

# 2. Overlay data on a static tmap
tmap_mode('plot')

berkeley_map <- tm_shape(berkeley) + 
  tm_borders(col = 'blue') +
tm_shape(bike_blvds) + 
  tm_lines(col = 'black') +
tm_shape(berkeley_schools) +
  tm_dots(col = "purple")

# 3. Overlay on interactive tmap
ttm()

berkeley_map

-->


## 4.5 Recap

In this lesson we learned several new skills:

- We looked at different R packages for making maps.
- Took a deeper look at `tmap` and interactive mapping
- Transformed a non-spatial data.frame into an `sf` spatial points data.frame - a very common work flow!
- Worked with point and line spatial dataframes and created map overlays


-----------------------------------

## 4.6 Teaser for Part 2...

You may be wondering if and how we could make our maps more interesting and informative than we have so far.

To give you a tantalizing taste of Part 2, the answer is yes, we can! And here's how (using an approach we hinted at earlier on)!

```{r}
tm_shape(schools_utm10) + 
  tm_dots(col = 'Org', 
          palette = 'RdYlGn',
          size = 0.15, 
          border.col = 'black',
          title = 'Public and Private Schools, Alameda County')
```
